# FilmCalendar2
This is a proof of concept for a Vidiots film schedule ICS calendar.
Import to Calendar on Mac or Google.
Goal for this:
Daily update of upcoming films. Calendar events would include Date, Start time, End time (based on Duration), Location (The Eagle / MUBI Microcinema), Description to include link to 'info' page for each screening and possibly also Film information.

To subscribe to the calendar, use the following link:
